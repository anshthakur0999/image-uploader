---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
GitHub → Jenkins (Local) → AWS ECR → K3s (EC2) → Production
```

**Components:**
- **Jenkins**: Running in Docker container locally
- **GitHub**: Source code repository
- **AWS ECR**: Private Docker registry
- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes on EC2
- **EC2**: t3.medium instance (54.86.145.29)

---

## 🔄 Deployment Flow

1. **Developer commits code** to GitHub
2. **Jenkins polls GitHub** every 5 minutes
3. **Detects changes** and starts build
4. **Builds Docker image** with version tag
5. **Pushes to ECR** (private registry)
6. **SSH to EC2** and runs kubectl
7. **Updates Kubernetes deployment** with new image
8. **Rolling update** replaces pods (zero downtime)
9. **Application live** at http://54.86.145.29:30080

**Total Time:** 5-10 minutes from commit to production

## 🔧 Key Setup Steps

### 1. Jenkins Installation
- Installed Jenkins in Docker container
- Mounted Docker socket for image builds
- Configured plugins (Docker, AWS, GitHub)

### 2. Credentials Configuration
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- AWS Access Keys (ECR access)
- SSH Key for EC2 access

### 3. Pipeline Creation
- 4-stage pipeline (Checkout, Build, Push, Deploy)
- Embedded pipeline script in Jenkins
- Environment variables for configuration

### 4. Tool Installation
- Docker CLI (for building images)
- AWS CLI (for ECR authentication)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes operations)
- SSH client (for EC2 deployment)

### 5. Kubernetes Setup
- Retrieved K3s kubeconfig from EC2
- Configured SSH deployment (more secure)
- Tested kubectl access via SSH

### 6. Automation Setup
- Enabled Poll SCM (every 5 minutes)
- Tested automatic builds
- Verified end-to-end flow

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Docker Not Found
**Problem:** Jenkins couldn't execute docker commands  
**Solution:** Installed Docker CLI in Jenkins container  
**Why:** Docker socket ≠ Docker CLI  

### Issue 2: AWS CLI Missing
**Problem:** Couldn't authenticate with ECR  
**Solution:** Installed AWS CLI in Jenkins container  
**Why:** Required for `aws ecr get-login-password`  

### Issue 3: Kubernetes Authentication
**Problem:** Kubeconfig pointed to deleted EKS cluster  
**Solution:** Used SSH deployment instead  
**Why:** More secure, no need to expose K8s API  

### Issue 4: Git Workspace Corruption
**Problem:** Git errors during checkout  
**Solution:** Switched to embedded pipeline script  
**Why:** Better control over checkout process  

### Issue 5: Credential Mismatch
**Problem:** Pipeline referenced wrong credential IDs  
**Solution:** Updated to use correct IDs  
**Why:** Credential IDs must match exactly

## 🔒 Security Measures

✅ **Credentials Management**
- GitHub PAT (not password)
- AWS IAM user with minimal permissions
- SSH key with 600 permissions

✅ **Network Security**
- Kubernetes API not exposed (port 6443 closed)
- SSH key-based authentication
- Private ECR registry

✅ **Container Security**
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Non-root user in containers
- Minimal Alpine base image

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

✅ **Docker Layer Caching**
- Dependencies in separate layer
- Build time: 15min → 5min

✅ **Rolling Updates**
- Zero downtime deployments
- Health checks ensure stability
- Automatic rollback on failure

✅ **Poll SCM Efficiency**
- 5-minute interval (balance speed/load)
- Hash-based randomization

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

**Monthly Costs:**
- EC2 t3.medium: ~$30-35
- ECR Storage: ~$0.10
- S3 Storage: ~$0.023/GB
- **Total: ~$35-40/month**

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 20 min/deployment (manual)
- After: 1 min/deployment (automated)
- **Savings: 19 min per deployment**
- **Weekly savings: 3-6 hours**

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
✅ Docker-in-Docker approach for Jenkins  
✅ SSH deployment (secure & simple)  
✅ Poll SCM (no need to expose Jenkins)  
✅ ECR for private registry  

### Best Practices Applied
✅ Infrastructure as Code (pipeline script)  
✅ Credential management (Jenkins credentials)  
✅ Zero downtime deployments (rolling updates)  
✅ Version tagging (build numbers)  

### Lessons Learned
- Docker socket ≠ Docker CLI (need both)
- SSH deployment > exposing K8s API
- Embedded pipeline > SCM pipeline (for stability)
- Explicit credentials > implicit assumptions

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
1. **GitHub Webhooks** - Instant builds (vs 5-min polling)
2. **Multi-Environment** - Staging + Production
3. **Automated Testing** - Unit/Integration tests
4. **Monitoring** - Prometheus + Grafana
5. **Notifications** - Slack/Email alerts
6. **Blue-Green Deployment** - Even safer deployments
7. **Auto-Scaling** - HPA based on traffic

## 📋 Maintenance Guide

### Daily Operations
- Monitor Jenkins builds
- Check application health
- Review logs if needed

### Weekly Tasks
- Review build history
- Clean up old Docker images
- Check EC2 disk usage

### Monthly Tasks
- Update dependencies
- Review AWS costs
- Security updates

### Troubleshooting
1. **Build fails** → Check Jenkins console
2. **Deploy fails** → Check SSH connectivity
3. **App down** → Check K3s pods
